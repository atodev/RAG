Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with [Gemini File Search](https://blog.google/technology/developers/file-search-gemini-api/) tool    

🏛️ Grounding Gemini on Ancient Wisdom: Marcus Aurelius (1887)The Challenge: OCR and AntiquityThis project demonstrates the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by tackling a unique source: an 1887 digitized copy of Marcus Aurelius' Meditations.Historical texts from that era, when converted to PDF or other formats, often suffer from poor Optical Character Recognition (OCR) due to aging paper, unique typefaces, and ink bleed. This results in numerous misspellings and unrecognizable characters that confuse standard text-based RAG pipelines (like the manual, chunking-based one in the adjacent file).The Breakthrough: Gemini File Search (Managed RAG)To overcome the limitations of manual RAG pipelines when dealing with complex data like this, we leveraged the Gemini File Search tool. This is a fully managed RAG system built directly into the Gemini API.How File Search Simplified the Process:Simplified Ingestion: We uploaded the full, corrupted PDF of Meditations (or the raw text file) to a File Search Store.Intelligent Processing: File Search automatically handles the complex pipeline:Advanced Chunking: Breaking the document into relevant pieces.State-of-the-Art Embeddings: It uses the latest Gemini Embedding model to convert the text chunks into vectors that capture semantic meaning, rather than relying purely on exact word matching. This is crucial—it allows the system to successfully retrieve corrupted words based on their context and meaning.One-Cell Solution: This entire process—from file upload, indexing, to querying—was orchestrated in a single notebook cell, abstracting away the need to manage a vector database, perform manual chunking, or handle the complexities of retrieval infrastructure.The Result: Verifiable Answers from the SourceBy using the File Search tool, Gemini can now accurately answer complex philosophical questions grounded entirely within the text of the 1887 edition of Meditations, providing direct citations to the original document, even when the underlying text is archaic and damaged.
